# Sven / Independent Study Project Due Dates

**By end of class on Thursday May 30,** post some (such as a code segment or a specific method) or all of your Sven source code (or something else pre-approved by Mr. Minich) to **YOUR** github repo that is devoted to the Sven project. While you should have a link to your repl.it Sven project in your repo's README file, you must also have one or more .java or .md files in the repo that specifically show something that you have done in the collaborative project.

**By Friday May 31,** be ready during class to explain your 2nd overall Sven-Version-1 contribution to the teacher and class.

**By Monday June 3,** use Markdown in one or more .md files in your Sven-related github repo. Be able to explain how you used Markdown by the day of the final exam. See this Markdown Cheatsheet at https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

**By the Final Exam date of June ?,** you must be ready to present with visuals (PowerPoint or Google slides, a video, infographic, etc.) your contributions. The instructor and audience will ask you questions about your contributions as well as the whole published project that you must be able to explain.
