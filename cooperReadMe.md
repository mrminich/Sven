Sven smart vending machine

https://repl.it/@CooperMcCaffrey/Java-Sven-version-1-4 For my update I improved the interface of the Sven demo. In order to do this I obtained ASCII art from http://www.angelfire.com/co/cajhnesplace/ascii/vend.html and heavily customized it to fit the look of Sven. I then implicated the ASCII art into the program by using a display method used on line 222. It is titled 

```displayMachine()```

I then went line by line copying each section of the ASCII art and adding them into the interface by using 29 System.out.println statements on lines 224-252. After I added the ASCII art into Minich's code Jack H got the great idea to color the ASCII art in order to make it even more appealing to the user and match the program. I also helped Justin K with his easter egg by putting a secret message into my ASCII art on the side of the vending machine. This easter egg is triggerd when the user types in "Minich" at any time. This then causes a small game of hangman to pop up in order for the user to play before or after they order from Sven.
