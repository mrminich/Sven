# Sven (Final) Project Specs (4th Quarter grade)

Post some (such as a code segment or a specific method) or all of your Sven source code (or something else pre-approved by Mr. Minich) to **YOUR** github repo that is devoted to the Sven project. While you should have a link to your repl.it Sven project in your repo's README file, you must also have one or more .java or .md files in the repo that specifically show something that you have done in the collaborative project.

You are responsible for two contributions or upgrades to the master Sven Version 1 project.

Use Markdown in one or more .md files in your Sven-related github repo. See this Markdown Cheatsheet at https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

**Final Exam specs**
Give an oral presentation in which you explain your 2nd overall Sven-Version-1 contribution to the teacher and class.
Use visuals (PowerPoint or Google slides, a video, infographic, etc.) to show your contributions to the audience. The instructor and audience will ask you questions about your contributions as well as the whole published project that you must be able to explain.

This "exam grade" is based on this presentation rubric at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GuinrJY8-_9447sIWWYHMEoyJGLg1SZaf6Eg6vAuUaU

**Highly recommended:**
- wear nice clothes (collar shirt) for your presentation that will be videotaped so you can edit it for your personal portfolio. A green screen is available.
- make photocopies of handouts or be ready to print them on the Room 311 printer
- The audience can sit around a table for Q & A or in row seating near the room's videoscreen
